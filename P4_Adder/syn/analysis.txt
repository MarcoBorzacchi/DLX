Analyzing the adder the critical path turned out to be the one that brought the carry to the 8th block of the sum generator.
The delay of the adder 0.68ns and it went down to 0.54ns after the optimization.

The delay of the sum generator was 0.47ns and was reduced to 0.43ns when the design was optimized.
On the other hand the delay of the sparse tree carry generator was  0.45ns and was reduced to 0.41ns by optimizing the design.
