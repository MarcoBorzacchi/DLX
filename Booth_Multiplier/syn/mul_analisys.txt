8 bit multiplier analisys

The critical path for this multiplier goes from the B input through the booth encoder to the second MUX, then into the adder and out of the P port.
The delay in this case was 0.83ns and it went down to 0.62ns after optimization.
After the optimization the critical path changed, now going through the 2's complement hardware to the first MUX then to the A input of the adder and finally out of the P port.

32 bit multiplier

the delay of the 32b booth multiplier was 4.59ns and it went down to 3.37ns after the optimization.
